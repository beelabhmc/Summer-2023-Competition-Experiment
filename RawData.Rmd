Load Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the CSV

```{r}
ants <- read_csv("Competition experiment data - Tidy Census.csv")
```
Make a graph for each colony (4 graphs). Group them by date (this will sort control vs treatment... should we add a column of this to the CSV?). Make a histogram of the count (workers + soldiers + queens) of ants in each nest. For each bar, the aesthetic should display worker count on the bottom and soldier count on the top. Add a symbol for the presence of queens or brood.
